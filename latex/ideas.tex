\section{Ideas for next time}

\begin{itemize}
\item you should move over all of the examples to \textsc{ipynb} format which will be nicer to present - you're doing it already but just carry on. - maybe not the intense ones like frequentist stuff (takes too long in notebooks).

\item Have a section thats just common pdfs. You already show Poissons, also show the chi2 and have a final one of Gaussians. Also in 2D - helpful for correlations 

\item Remove the hypotest with spin-1/spin-0. I don't like it. Replace with something more concrete (like the spin test and use histograms? or a nicer functional form?). Or just create some data for it and do a full test. actually lets do a lifetime example test for b vs c decay and decay distance!

\item I removed gof test. Instead, lets go over the multidim fit and cover things like Hessian and covariance matrix from the likelihood. can c.f chi2 tests if you like. 
Actually lets put it back but use it as another  hypotest example. i will do mdf in 2 D but as asymptotic and compare to the gradient approx ie the chi2 is a quadratic near the minimum, so do that later in intervals.
\end{itemize}
